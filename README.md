# Project - January 2022 - Data Viz Portal

## Introduction

In the Spring of 2022, I am teaching students about data visualization. In an effort to help students with the learning process, I came up with the concept of a website that would provide opportunities to learn and test their knowledge about data visualization. The result of this work was the Data Viz Portal. This website has the goal of helping students discover and learn about data visualization on an attractive and interactive space.

#### The Challenge

Students enrolled in the class called Introduction to Data Visualization can find it difficult to wade through all the information that is available to them about understanding and building data visualizations. They can feel overwhelmed if there's either too much information or it's not organized in a way that is easy to understand. Students also need to test their learning, which is an important part of the learning process.

#### The Solution

A website that combines both the collection of resources in one place with the ability of students to take quizzes to test their knowledge is meant to create a single website to address many student needs.
