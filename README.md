# Project - January 2022 - Data Viz Portal

The purpose of the Data Viz Portal is to provide a website that gives access to useful information about Data Visualization. It's also a place for students to test their knowledge of data visualization by taking quizzes. Students also share their opinions each week by completing polls, which are then visualized to analyze the data collected.
